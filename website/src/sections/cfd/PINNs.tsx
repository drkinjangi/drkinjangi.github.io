        <p>
          Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) represent a paradigm shift in scientific computing by embedding physical laws directly into neural networks. Unlike traditional purely data-driven approaches, PINNs incorporate differential equations as soft constraints during training, ensuring physical consistency in predictions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach bridges the gap between numerical simulations and machine learning, offering advantages in terms of computational efficiency, differentiability, and the ability to handle sparse or noisy data. For CFD applications, PINNs can dramatically reduce simulation time while maintaining physical accuracy.
